## Commit Time Tests

Thanks for helping us with this project! We're looking to get 2 durations from you:

- Duration of making a commit in the CLI
- Duration of making a commit in GitKraken

### What you need

- Please first fork this repo on GitHub
- Clone your fork to your local machine (it's okay to use GK)
- Have a text editor handy (VS Code, Atom, Notepad++ etc)
- Locate the stopwatch feature on your phone or any other app

### Test 1: Make a commit in the CLI

Please follow these instructions for your first time test. Don't start until you have forked and cloned the repo.

1. Start your timer
2. Launch the CLI
3. Use the cd command to change directory to where your repo is located. For example, I used `cd ~/Sites/Commit-Time-Test`
4. Checkout the `feature` branch
5. Edit lines 45 and 46 of the index.html
6. Fix typo in line 1 of mkdocs.yml so it says GitKraken Documentation
7. Answer prompt on music.md file
8. Stage changes from index.html, mkdocs.yml, and music.md using `git add` command
9. Commit changes using `git commit` command. 
          Commit message: "Personalized bio and fixed typo"
          Commit description: "Updated the name and bio in the index.html file, shared a favorite song, and changed GitCrack to GitKraken.
10. Stop timer and write down duration.


PAUSE HERE!!

Do 1 of the following before moving on to Test 2
 - Delete local repo and re-clone
 - Hard reset feature branch in GK to remove commit from Test 1.



### Test 2: Make a commit in the GK

Please follow these instructions for your first time test. Don't start until you have forked and cloned the repo.

1. Start your timer
2. Launch GitKraken
3. Open repo
4. Checkout the `feature` branch
5. Edit lines 45 and 46 of the index.html
6. Fix typo in line 1 of mkdocs.yml 
7. Answer prompt on music.md file
8. Stage changes from index.html, mkdocs.yml, and music.md using `git add` command
9. Commit changes using `git commit` command. 
          Commit message: "Personalized bio and fixed typo"
          Commit description: "Updated the name and bio in the index.html file, shared a favorite song, and changed GitCrack to GitKraken.
10. Stop timer and write down duration.


That's it! Please submit your durations to your test proctor. Thanks so much for your help.
