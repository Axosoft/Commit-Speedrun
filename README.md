## Commit Time Tests

Thanks for helping us with this project! We're looking to get 2 durations from you:

- Duration of making a commit in the CLI
- Duration of making a commit in GitKraken

### What you need

- Please first fork this repo on GitHub
- Clone your fork to your local machine (it's okay to use GK)
- Have a text editor handy (VS Code, Atom, Notepad++ etc)
- Locate the stopwatch feature on your phone or any other app

Please follow these prep step instructions, but make sure you have forked and cloned the repo.

### Pre-test: Make changes

1. Edit lines 45 and 46 of the index.html
2. Fix typo in line 1 of mkdocs.yml so it says GitKraken Documentation
3. Answer prompt on music.md file
4. Edit line 3 of the reset.css file and change license from none to MIT
5. Change line 6 of ukdocs.yml from UNIX to index
6. Answer prompt on movie.md file

### Test 1: Make a commit in the CLI


1. Start your timer
2. Launch the CLI
3. Use the cd command to change directory to where your repo is located. For example, I used `cd ~/Sites/Commit-Time-Test`
4. Checkout the `feature` branch
5. Stage changes from index.html, mkdocs.yml, and music.md using `git add` command
6. Commit changes using `git commit` command. 
          Commit message: "Personalized bio and fixed typo"
          Commit description: "Updated the name and bio in the index.html file, shared a favorite song, and changed GitCrack to GitKraken.
7. Stop timer and write down duration.



### Test 2: Make a commit in the GK


1. Start your timer
2. Launch GitKraken
3. Open repo
4. Checkout the `feature` branch
5. Stage changes from reset.css, ukdocs.yml, and movie.md using Commit Panel
6. Commit changes with the following mesage and descrition.
          Commit message: "Updated license type and fixed typo"
          Commit description: "Updated the license type in the reset.css file, shared a favorite movie, and changed UNIX to index.
7. Stop timer and write down duration.


That's it! Please submit your durations to your test proctor. Thanks so much for your help.
